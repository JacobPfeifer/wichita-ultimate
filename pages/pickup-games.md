Pickup is the lowest barrier to entry way to meet new people and play ultimate in Wichita. The games are free and open to all. Here is our best effort to catalog all the games happening in Wichita and the surrounding area. If you are completely new to the the Wichita Ultimate community, it's a good idea to check out the external discussion to make sure the game is still happening as scheduled or to get an idea of the attendance.
