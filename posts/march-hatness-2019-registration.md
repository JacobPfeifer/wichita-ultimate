March Hatness is an indoor mixed-gender hat tournament hosted by Wichita Ultimate! We wanted to take advantage of the new indoor facility at the Stryker Sports Complex while the weather is still crummy. The field is a full-size soccer field with rubber turf. Cleats are recommended!

You are able to sign up solo or as a pair with one other person. Included in the registration fee is a team jersey!

Early Bird Registration ($25) ends Friday March 15th. The last day to register at full price ($30) is Friday March 22nd.

All play levels are welcome and encouraged to attend! Come and join the fun!
