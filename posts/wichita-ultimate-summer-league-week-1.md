And.....here....we....go!

The first week of summer league is officially here and we are so excited for it to start!

We hope you have heard from your captains and are excited to meet your teammates tomorrow and get the season started.  
We are extremely sorry we weren't able to reschedule the Beginner Clinic this year.  With the holiday weekend combined with all the rain we have been getting, we knew it would be hard to reschedule.  We will be talking as the summer goes on and see if we can figure something out to help the new people to the league.  I am also positive your captains will do an amazing job at teaching everyone and helping those who have questions about the rules, how to play, and Spirit of the Game.
If you have any questions, talk to your captain or find me or Kristina and we would be glad to help.

Quick pulls:
- Games start at 7 tomorrow at Brownthrush Park in Wichita.
- We would recommend showing up around 6 tomorrow for registration.  We will have tables near the Central Hub.  That is where you will get your shirt and pay dues ($35 for most people).If you are paying with check, make it to Jordan Ast.  
Discs will be in next week.
- I will be adding an attachment made by a former league player with some tips and helpful tricks to make the summer league the best it can be.
- After the games, feel free to go out to grab a drink or bite with your teammates and friends.  There are lots of bars and restaurants near by (I'll probably go to BWW to watch game 1 of the NBA Finals) 
- Have fun you must
