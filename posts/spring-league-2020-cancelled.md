As of Sunday March 15, we have not been able to secure a refund from Stryker Sports Complex for our rental. If anyone wants full or partial refund, we will absolutely honor those requests. But, if you are in a position to help us with our payment, it would be very much appreciated. In the event that Stryker does grant a full refund, we will pass that on back to those who have already paid, regardless if they request it or not.

Thank you,\
