Fellow frisbee’ers,

We hope you all enjoyed last week at our first game of the season!  Thank you for coming out and making this league so amazing!  Without you playing, it would literally be nothing, so once again thank you very much!

We also want to thank our volunteers, the Wickham family and Kiana Broadly, for making our registration go so smoothly last week.  They got there early with me and helped get everything set up and ready to go so we could get people their stuff as quickly as possible.  For those who weren’t able to be there last week, we will once again have a mini registration table set up for collecting money and giving your league shirt to you.

LEAGUE DISCS ARE IN!  They look great and seem to be in great flying condition.  We will have them there tomorrow so make sure you come and get yours.  If you want an extra, come find me or Kristina.  They are $10 each.

Quick Pulls:

- We and the League Committee are keeping a close eye on the weather tomorrow.  We are hoping to still play if the weather is okay, but prepare for week 2 of playing on wet ground. 

 - If we need to cancel, we will announce by 5:00 on Facebook, email, and twitter. 

- We will also be having a whole League meeting at 6:45 so make sure to get there early to warm up, get some throws in, and go over things with your team and captain.

- We hope that you have a fun time tomorrow and learn a lot from your captains.  Remember, if you have any questions about what to do when you play please talk to your captains and they will be more than glad to coach you.  If they are unavailable, find a veteran player and they will also be happy to help you get better and learn how to play.

If anyone knows of someone who would be up for taking pictures for league, please send me an email.
