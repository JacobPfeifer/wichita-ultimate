[Lover's Quarrel](https://ultimatecentral.com/en_us/e/lovers-quarrel-2020) is an indoor, mixed-gender hat tournament hosted by Wichita Ultimate! Come take advantage of the indoor facility at the Stryker Sports Complex during the winter months. The field is a full-size soccer field with rubber turf infill.

`The playing ratio will be a 3 male-matching (M-M) : 2 female-matching (F-M) players on the field at all times. In order to keep playing time equitable, registration for M-M players will likely be capped. F-M Solo, F-M/F-M Pairs, and F-M/M-M Pairs will be accepted first and are guaranteed a spot. MM Solo and M-M/M-M Pair registrations will then be accepted in chronological order until the upper limit has been reached.`
