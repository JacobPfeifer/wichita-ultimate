Wichita Ultimate Spring League has been cancelled due to concerns over COVID-19. This comes on the heels of USA [Ultimate's decision](https://www.usaultimate.org/news/usa-ultimate-response-to-coronavirus/) to cancel upcoming events along with the [CDC's new recommendation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/large-events/considerations-for-events-gatherings.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Flarge-events%2Fmass-gatherings-ready-for-covid-19.html) to cancel all events with 50 or more people for the next 8 weeks.

As of Sunday March 15, we have not been able to secure a refund from Stryker Sports Complex for our rental. If anyone wants full or partial refund, we will absolutely honor those requests. But, if you are in a position to help us with our payment, it would be very much appreciated. In the event that Stryker does grant a full refund, we will pass that on back to those who have already paid, regardless if they request it or not.

Thank you,
Jacob Pfeifer
